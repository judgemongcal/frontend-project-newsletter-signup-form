## My process

In this project, I started working with the HTML structure followed by the mobile design of the project. Once it was finished, I then switched to coding the JS functionalities. After that is finished, I moved on with the Desktop view of the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design
- Vanilla JS

### Continued Development

After this project, I'm going to start diving deep to learn more about JS and being familiar with it enough to build more complex projects. I will also be seeking for code feedbacks/improvements from other devs online.
